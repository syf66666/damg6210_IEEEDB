DB for IEEE articles(ASE & ICSE). Aims to figure out what are the recent hot topics, authors, affiliations in software engineering

We are going to create a scholar database about software engineering articles. First we will scratch the data from some scholar article websites. Then we will make up the database with core features. Finally we may use machine learning skills to figure out what the hot topics in software engineering. We believe this database will give students great convenience to choose a topic in software engineering.
